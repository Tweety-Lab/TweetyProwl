> [!NOTE]
> Prowl is currently in early development and not yet stable for production use. While the core functionality is in place, expect frequent changes, missing features, and potential bugs. Enthusiasts and contributors are welcome to explore and help shape the engine, but we recommend waiting for a more stable release before using it for serious game projects.

# <span align="center">📝 About The Project 📝

Prowl is an open-source, **[MIT-licensed](#span-aligncenter-license-span)** game engine developed in **pure C# in latest .NET**.

It aims to provide a seamless transition for developers familiar with _Unity_ by maintaining a similar API while also following KISS and staying as small and customizable as possible. Ideally, _Unity_ projects can port over with as little resistance as possible.

Please keep in mind that Prowl is incredibly new and unstable, and it is not yet Game Ready, however, we are hopeful that Prowl will be stable and ready by the end of this year.

- Hat tip to the creators of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), While we are no longer based upon it, it has shaved off hours of development time getting the engine to a usable state.
- Some ideas/code have been taken from the amazing 2D Engine [Duality](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality).
